# HR-Analysis
This HR Analytics project provides data-driven insights to improve employee management, absenteeism tracking, and HR policy effectiveness. The Power BI dashboards make it easier to monitor trends and take action for better workforce productivity.

The Attendance Sheet file contains multiple sheets for different months and an "Attendance Key" sheet, which likely explains how attendance data is recorded. Now, I will inspect the structure of one of these sheets to understand the data format. This project focuses on analyzing employee attendance and HR metrics using Power BI and an attendance dataset.

1. Understanding the Attendance Data

2. Possible HR Insights
With this dataset, the HR Analytics project can extract insights such as:
Employee Attendance Trends
How many employees were present/absent on a given day?
What are the most common leave types taken?
Leave and Absenteeism Analysis
Identifying employees with high absenteeism.
Analyzing trends in sick leaves, paid leaves, and WFH usage.
Department-Wise or Employee-Wise Trends
Which department has the highest absenteeism?
Who are the most punctual employees?
Work-from-Home Analysis
How many employees opt for remote work (WFH)?
Does WFH impact overall attendance consistency?
Policy Evaluation
Are weekly offs and holiday leaves distributed properly?
Is the menstrual leave policy being used effectively?

The data visualization tool we have use is power BI
The .pbix file suggests that Power BI dashboards were built to visualize:
Employee attendance trends (monthly, weekly)
Leave distribution analysis
Department-wise attendance breakdown
Comparing different types of leave usage
